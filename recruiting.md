### Graduate Research Assistantships
A Graduate Research Assistant (GRA) is a funded position. This salary is usually $27,000 annual stipend, disbursed monthly, and 6 credit hours of tuition support. GRAs complete project work (i.e., a line of research that pertains to the funding source) and complete lab work (i.e., a line of research that generally cross-cuts multiple topics and supports the lab's research themes). The lab is primarily looking for students intending to complete their PhD.

These positions are only open to students that have completed at least one of the following:
* has received an A mark in _Introduction to Knowledge Engineering_
* has satisfactorily completed an exploratory research project or an independent study, either under my instruction
* has completed a Master's thesis on a topic related to the lab's research topics.

**Unforunately, there are currently no open positions in this category.**

### DAGSI Fellowships
Each year, the [Defense Associated Graduate Student Innovators (DAGSI) program](https://www.soche.org/college-students/dagsi-student-research/), as an arm of the Strategic Ohio Council of Higher Education (SOCHE) solicits proposals on a range of topics through their annual Call for Proposals (CfP). Each year, there are generally one or two CfPs that pertain to the lab's research themes. 

If you are interested in a DAGSI topic that aligns with KASTLE research themes, please contact kastle(dash)pca(at)wright(dot)edu

**The lab can currently support up to one more student in this capacity starting Summer 2026.**

### Graduate Teaching Assistantships
I may make _informal_ recommendations for those students which have completed a course where I was the instructor, and the student received an A mark. Final determination of GTA positions, however, is made by the department _and I do not have any final say_. 

**Do not e-mail me about such positions, as the e-mail will be discarded without response. Thank you.**

### Doctoral Dissertation Supervision
If you are interested in completing your Doctoral Dissertation in Computer Science (PhD CS) and you are interested in knowledge engineering or neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (some possible topics are given on the [research page](./research.md)), please reach out to me at cogan(dot)shimizu(at)wright(dot)edu.

* Please note that this _unfunded_ lab membership. However, pending the availability and acquisition of funds, they can transform into a funded GRA position.

**The lab can currently support up to one more student in this capacity for Spring 2026.**

### Master's Thesis Supervision
If you are interested in completing your Master's Thesis in Computer Science (MSCS) and you are interested in knowledge engineering or neurosymbolic artificial intelligence (some possible topics are given on the [research page](./research.md)), please reach out to me at cogan(dot)shimizu(at)wright(dot)edu.

* During the completion of a Master's Thesis, a student may count up to 9 credit hours of research towards your Program of Study, as well as an additional 3 credit hours of independent study. This means a reduction of 12 credit hours of formal coursework. Please see the [course catalog](https://catalog.wright.edu/preview_program.php?poid=19624&catoid=23) for additional information.
* Please note that this _unfunded_ lab membership. However, pending the availability and acquisition of funds, they can transform into a funded GRA position.

**The lab can currently support up to one more student in this capacity for Spring 2026.**

### Research Projects
If you are interested in collaborating or conducting an exploratory voluntary project regarding one of the topics in the [research page](./research.md), please feel free to reach out to me at kastle(dash)pca(at)wright(dot)edu. **Please note that this is not funded, does not count as an independent study (see below), and does not count as research hours! This is purely if you have personal interest in the topics.**

**The lab can currently support up to three more students in this capacity for Spring 2026.**

### Independent Studies
Please see the [research page](./research.md) for possible topics. These can be scoped to an appropriate level of effort and commitment.

**The lab can currently support up to three more students in this capacity for Spring 2026.**

#### Requesting an Independent Study
An independent study will always consist of a kick-off meeting at the start of the semester where we outline the specific trajectory of the course plan. It will be followed by at least 10 updates over the course of the semester where  progress will be reported. These updates will be reasonable, oral presentations coupled with a few (well-made) slides. A final report (or presentation) will be due (or conducted) at the end of the semester. There are several example topics on the [research page](./research.md). 

To initiate requesting an independent study, please complete the following steps:
1. Contact me via e-mail to book an appointment; be sure to copy kastle(dash)pca(at)wright(dot)edu.
2. Please be prepared to discuss a topic. A description of the proposed topic(s) must be included.
3. After we have met and agreed on a topic, please fill out the [Graduate Consent form](https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/computer-science-and-engineering/forms-and-documents).

### Departmental Honors Theses
The lab welcomes high-performing undergraduate students that wish to complete a [Departmental Honors Thesis (DHT)](https://engineering-computer-science.wright.edu/computer-science-and-engineering/departmental-honors-program). You will have access to the lab's resources and support structures during the research period. A DHT comprises two 3-credit hour independent studies, with the intent to **(a)** conduct a research project and **(b)** give formal presentation over a written deliverable encapsulating the research project. The lab is primarily interested in DHT topics as listed in the [research page](./research.md). If you are interested in completing a DHT against one of those topics under the (collective) supervision of the lab, reach out to me at kastle(dash)pca(at)wright(dot)edu.

**The lab can currently support up two more students in this capacity.**

### Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) Scholars
The lab is committed to maintaining a diverse, inclusive, and equitable environment and membership, as well as improving such qualities in the broader computer science ecosystem. Unfortunately, this congressionally-appropriated program has been cancelled by the Trump administration, and we unable accept students through this program. We are additionally hindered by the Ohio SB1.

**Unfortunately, there are currently no open positions in this category.**

### Undergraduate Research Assistant 
Occasionally, the lab requires additional personpower to complete fundamental research tasks. This might include data collection, literature review, and experimental design and execution.

**Unfortunately, there are currently no open positions in this category.**

### Scientific Programmer I or II
Occasionally, the lab has a need for expertise related to implementation of software systems, tools, or other artefacts. This role will require a high-performing student capable of independent discovery and execution of deliverables. The wage range is expected to be $13-$17/hr (depending on role) at 5 hrs/week.

**These positions are posted on Handshake, if available.**

### Program Coordinator Assistant
